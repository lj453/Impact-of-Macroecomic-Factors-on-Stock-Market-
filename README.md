# **IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC FACTORS ON STOCK MARKET AND STOCK PRICE PREDICTION**

## **Executive summary**

A stock market is a type of marketplace that facilitates the buying and selling of publicly traded company stocks and other types of securities. It is a significant source of capital for businesses, and it presents an opportunity for individuals as well as institutions to make investments. In determining the performance of the stock market and stock prices, macroeconomic factors are essential. GDP, inflation, interest rates, employment, and political stability are a few of these elements. Investors can make better decisions about when to buy or sell stocks by having a solid understanding of how these macroeconomic factors may affect stock prices. There are different types of stock market analysis: 

1.**Technical analysis**: This approach looks for patterns and trends in historical data and charts that might predict future market movements.

2.**Fundamental analysis**: In this technique, financial and economic information about a company, such as revenue and earnings, is examined to make predictions about the company's future performance.
  
3.**Quantitative analysis (Time Series Analysis)**: This technique examines a lot of data and generates market forecasts using mathematical models and algorithms.
   
In this project, we are focusing on the Technical and Quantitative Analysis of Apple Inc. The dataset is taken from Yahoo Finance from 2010 January to 2022 November. Macroeconomic factors like GDP, Consumer Index Price (CPI) and the  Unemployment rate were selected to find out which factor has the most influence on Apple Stock price.

This project gives an overview of the difficulty is to predict the stock price accurately as it is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including economic, political, social, and psychological factors. The future is inherently uncertain, and there are many unknowns that can impact the stock market, such as natural disasters, political events, and technological breakthroughs. These factors can interact in unpredictable ways, making it difficult to predict market movements.

This project main purpose to focus on the following points:

•	 How do Apple's historical stock prices and financial results compare to those of other significant tech firms?<br>
•	How can technical indicators be used to forecast stock price movements for short-term trading? • Which technical indicators have been found to be the most accurate at doing so?<br>
•	 How do macroeconomic factors like GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and the consumer price index affect the stock prices of companies that are publicly traded?<br>
•	How can a model be created that can show how a macroeconomic variable affects the stock market and which macroeconomic factor has the biggest impact on the price of Apple stock?<br>
•	Which model is more effective at forecasting stock price information?<br>

After fixing the research questions a lot of research papers were analysed. From the literature review, I gained insights to my problem statement: <br>

•	Developing a deeper comprehension of the impact of various macroeconomic factors on various stock markets<br>
•	Importance of technical indicators and which all technical indicators such as MACD, Bollinger Bands are effective at forecasting changes in stock prices for short-term trading.<br>
•	Using macroeconomic variables to predict stock prices and effectively identify the most important factors influencing the stock market using Random Forest<br>
•	How LSTM is so good at predicting and forecasting stock prices using historical data.<br>
